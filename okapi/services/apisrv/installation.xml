        Retrieve some basic information about this OKAPI installation.
    </desc>
    <common-format-params/>
    <returns>
        <p>A dictionary of the following structure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>site_name</b> - universal name for this site (should be fine
                for all languages),
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>site_url</b> - URL of the Opencaching site which is running
                the OKAPI installation (usually this looks like
                "http://www.opencaching.<i>xx</i>/", where <b>xx</b> is a top
                level domain of a country). If you prefer either http or https
                access, evaluate <b>https</b> to find out if the desired
                scheme is available, and eventually replace the scheme in the
                <b>site_url</b> string.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>okapi_base_url</b> - URL of the OKAPI installation (usually this is
                <b>site_url</b> with "okapi/" appended, but you should not assume
                that); this value is to be used as a prefix when constructing service
                method URLs. If you prefer either http oder https access, evaluate
                <b>https</b> to find out if the desired scheme is available, and
                eventually replace the scheme in the <b>okapi_base_url</b> string.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>https</b> - https support of the Opencaching site and the OKAPI
                installation; one of the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>unavailable</b> - https will not work (properly) or will be redirected to http,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>availaible</b> - http and https will both work,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>recommended</b> - http and https will both work, but http is
                        deprecated; if your application allows it, use https,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>enforced</b> - http will be redirected to https.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>okapi_version_number</b> - integer; the version number of
                the OKAPI instance installed on this Opencaching site, <b>or
                null</b>, if the version number could not be determined.</p>

                <p>The version number will be incremented with each new
                revision of OKAPI (that is, after every commit to OKAPI
                repository).</p>

                <p>You can use it to check if this OKAPI installation will be
                compatbile with your client application: if the number is
                equal to or higher than the one you have expected, then it will
                be compatible.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>okapi_revision</b> - this is an older alias of
                <b>okapi_version_number</b>.</p>

                <p>For a number of years, OKAPI used SVN for version control.
                SVN uses integers for commit IDs. Hence, version numbers and
                revision numbers were exactly the same thing. (In fact, the
                <b>okapi_version_number</b> field has been introduced only
                <i>after</i> OKAPI has been migrated to Git.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>git_revision</b> - string, the Git revision of the OKAPI
                project installed on this Opencaching site, <b>or null</b>,
                when it could not be determined.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </returns>
